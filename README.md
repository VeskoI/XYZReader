## XYZReader

Project 5 from [Udacity Android Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/android-developer-nanodegree--nd801).

**XYZReader** is a mock RSS feed reader featuring banner photos and shocking headlines! The code for the app was received from Udacity.

My task was to re-styled the app so that it implements [Material Design](https://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/introduction.html). It uses the [Support Design Library](http://android-developers.blogspot.bg/2015/05/android-design-support-library.html) and best compatibility practices.

_NOTE_: Although it satisfies the project requirements, the code is still far, far from perfect.
